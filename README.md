# Memory Game

A simple game of memory

![GamePic](memoryGame/memGame.png)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Here is a fun little game of memory. I used the fisher-yates method for shuffling by pushing sections into an array and then pulling that array and placing into random sections. Afterward the user can click on each box and flip the card to hopefully match them all and then get a Game Over alert signifying the win.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned about the Fisher-yates methond and learned more about event listeners and creating a game.
